Subject: New twitter game launching Tuesday

Dear __________,

I'm writing to let you know about a new twitter game that's launching early next week. The motivation to play is: "Can you predict what's going to be hot on twitter?" Because of ______________, I thought you might be interested in covering the game.

Pretweeting is a market game for twitter: you amass (virtual) riches every round by buying and selling words, which are priced based on how frequently they're mentioned on twitter. To win, you have to predict what's going to be hot and buy it up before it hits twitter. Once people start mentioning the words you've chosen, their prices will rise and your portfolio will go through the roof!

There's a whole ecosystem of different words. The English top 100 words ("the", "and", "or", etc.) are the blue chip stocks of the twittersphere. Some words, like "dinner", "#followfriday", and "sleep", have very predictable cycles. But you'll need to follow current events to really know when the best picks, topical words like "ipod" or "lakers", will hit it big.

The game is in pre-launch mode now -- you can check it out and play at http://prelaunch.pretweeting.com/. Login with your twitter account: all in-game twitter posting functionality is disabled prior to launch. You can get a screenshot and logo set is here: http://pretweeting.com/static_media/other/demo_images.zip

The public version goes live this coming Tuesday at noon PT. I'm happy to provide any further information you'd be interested in.

Best wishes, and have a great weekend!
